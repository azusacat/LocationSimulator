Before you ask a question: 

1. Read the Help menu entry of LocationSimulator. Start `LocationSimulator` and choose `Help` -> `LocationSimulator Help` in the menubar. 
2. Check the already closed issues on github.

Beta versions of macOS or iOS are not supported! The Help entry explains how to manually manage DeveloperDiskImages in this case.

- [ ] I have read the Help menu entry.
- [ ] I have checked the github issues.
